# Health Risk Assessment Web Page

## Project Overview

This project is a redesign of the current [https://www.hra.co.ke](HRA) web page. It aims to enhance user experience, improve website performance, and align with the brand's evolving goals.

## Key Objectives

#### Enhance User Experience

Responsive design has been given keen attention as user experience across platforms and devices is of utmost importance.

The information offered by the page is streamlined while keeping it relevant to what a user would want to know about the brand.

A user now has the capability to book an appointment. Once the form is filled, on submission, an email with the information that the user has given is sent. The user's appointment is then scheduled.

A user can now join a group where relevant health information is shared should they wish.

#### Brand Alignment

The business logo which is key to its identity is featured prominently on the page with some animation added to it depending on the screen size.

The flow of information has been made interactive and visually appealing.
